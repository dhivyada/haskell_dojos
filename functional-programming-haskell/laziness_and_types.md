> Part 5.1

* This week, we are going to explore some of Haskell’s features that make it so distinctive, as a programming language. 
    * These include `laziness`, `infinite data structures` and `type inference`.


* We will also review `Haskell deployments` in the real world, when we meet `Katie Ots` from `Facebook`.


* As **Larry Wall** once said, one of the main virtues of the programmer is `laziness`. 
  

* `Laziness` is also a key feature of Haskell. 
  

* And this week, you will learn what `laziness` and `strictness` really mean. So far, we have used types in our programs but we have actually glossed over the details. 
  

* And in Haskell, `types` are a really essential part of the language and the `type system` is very powerful. 
  

* This week, you will learn about `function types`, `type variables`, and `type classes`.
  

* We will also show you Haskell can `infer` the types of expressions in a program so that you don’t have to provide the type information for every single expression.
