> Part 3.1


We will go a little deeper into functional programming. The concept of `recursion` is a key design pattern. You will see that `recursion is a natural way to process list data`. We are going to look at `list combinators`, like `map` and `fold`. While we are only operating on small lists, these are exactly the operations that analysts use to crunch big data on massive clusters.

After a brief excursion into `tree data types`, we will uncover some of the history of Haskell towards the end of the week. Jeremy interviews Simon Peyton Jones, who works at Microsoft Research Cambridge. Simon is an honorary Professor at Glasgow, and one of the lead designers of Haskell.

Agenda:
* Exploring the list data structure in even more detail
* Defining custom data structures - an important part of any high level programming language.
* History of haskell - where did it come from, why does it look like it does ðŸ™‚
