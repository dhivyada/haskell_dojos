#Expressions
Haskell has no statements, only expressions!

* In an imperative language like C or Java,
    * there are expressions that denote small scale computations (2*x), and 
    * statements that handle sequencing, looping, conditionals, and all the large scale operation of the program.
* Pure functional programming languages don’t have any statements — no assignments, no jumps.
* Instead, all computation is performed by evaluating expressions
* So, let’s start with expressions!
    * (We’ll still be working on expressions at the end of the course, since that’s all there is.)

###Examples of integer expressions

####An expression evaluates to a result (usually written but we’ll use e -- > r). Haskell uses a similar notation for numbers and operators as most languages:

    2 -- > 2
    3+4 -- > 7
    3+4*5    {equivalent to 3+(4*5)} -- > 23
    (3+4)*5   {equivalent to 7*5} -- > 35

####Syntax of expressions

* Parentheses are used for grouping, just as in mathematics.
* If you don’t need parentheses for grouping, they are optional.
* Operators have precedence, e.g. `*` has “tighter” precedence than `+` , so `2+3*4` means `2+(3*4)`
* Use the [reference documentation](https://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/exps.html) for complete list of operators and their precedences, if you need them.

####Function applications

* Expressions can contain function calls.
* A function takes argument(s), performs some computation, and produces result(s).
* The function abs gives the absolute value of a number.
* To use a function, you apply it to an argument. Write the function followed by the argument, separated by a space.

```
abs 5 -- > 5
abs (-6) -- > 6
```


####Parentheses are for grouping

Good style

```
2+3*5
2+(3*5) -- might be clearer to some readers
abs 7
```

You don’t need parentheses. The following are legal, but they look silly:
```
(2) + ((3+(((((5)))))))
abs (5)
abs (((5)))
```
Functions with several arguments

* min and max are functions that take two arguments.
* The arguments are given after the function, separated by whitespace.
* Write `min 3 8`, don’t write `min (3,8)`;
```
min 3 8 -- > 3
max 3  8 -- > 8
```

Precedence of function application

* Function application binds tighter than anything else.
* So `f x + 3` means `(f x) + 3` and not `f (x+3)`
* If an argument to a function is an expression, you’ll need to put it in parentheses.

#Equations
####Equations give names to values

* Equations are used to give names to values.

```
answer = 42
```
* An equation in Haskell is a mathematical equation: it says that the left hand side and the right hand side denote the same value.
* The left hand side should be a name that you’re giving a value to.
* Correct: x = 5*y
* Incorrect: 2 * x = (3*x)**2 – Reassignment is not allowed in a pure FPL

####Equations are not assignments

* A name can be given only one value.
* Names are often called “variables”, but they do not vary.
* In Haskell variables are constant!
```
n = 1   -- just fine!
x = 3 * n  -- fine
n = x    -- Wrong: can have only one definition of n
```
* Once you give a value to a name, you can never change it!
* This is part of the meaning of “pure” and “no side effects”

What about n = n+1?

* In imperative languages, we frequently say n := n + 1 
* This is an assignment, not an equation! 
* It means (1) compute the right hand side, using the old value of n; then (2) discard the old value of n and overwrite it with the new value.

* There are no equations in imperative languages like C and Java.
    * In Haskell, it is valid to write n = n + 1.
        This is an equation, not an assignment!
* It means: compute the value of n that has the property that n = n + 1.
  

* Haskell will try, and it will fail.

####How can you compute without assignments?

* Think of an assignment statement as doing three things:
        * It evaluates the right hand side: computing a useful value.
        * It discards the value of the variable on the left hand side: destroying a value that might or might not be useful.
        * It saves the useful value of the RHS into the variable.
* In a pure functional language
        * We never destroy old values.
* We just compute new useful ones.
* If the old value was truly useless, the garbage collector will reclaim its storage.

> An expression assigned to a literal is an equation (Anything with an = sign is an equation, effectively)
