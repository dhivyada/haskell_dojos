#Functional programming Haskell
These examples are from the free course from the University of Glasgow

###How to invoke the playground
* Install haskell on your machine
* Use `ghci` command (this opens the haskell REPL for us)
* And we are presented with a prompt `Prelude>`. The Haskell system now awaits our input.
