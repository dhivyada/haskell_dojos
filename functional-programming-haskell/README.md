#Functional programming Haskell
These examples are from the free course from the University of Glasgow

###How to invoke the playground
* Install haskell on your machine
* Use `ghci` command (this opens the haskell REPL for us)
* And we are presented with a prompt `Prelude>`. The Haskell system now awaits our input. 
* To exit the Haskell interpreter, type `quit` at the interactive prompt.

####Differences between Statements and Expressions

Notes:
* Haskell has only statements (Pure functional programming languages don’t have any statements — no assignments, no jumps. Instead, all computation is performed by evaluating expressions)
* Haskell uses only spaces to identify function arguments, no parenthesis
* Type declarations and function definitions are separate
