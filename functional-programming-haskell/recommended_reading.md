#Recommended Reading

**4 Textbook Recommendations & links to websites from Simon Thompson at the University of Kent**

####_Real World Haskell_

[Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) is a typical O’Reilly programming language book. The content is available online for free, along with reader comments.

####_Learn You a Haskell_

[Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com) is a very informal introduction, but it does a great job of explaining complex concepts. You can [read it online](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters) for free. Some people don’t like the author’s sense of humour, but I thought it was mostly ok.

####_Programming in Haskell_

[Programming in Haskell](http://www.cambridge.org/9781316626221) by Graham Hutton is a simple and succinct introduction to Haskell programming.

####_Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming_

[Haskell: the Craft of Functional Programming](http://www.haskellcraft.com/craft3e/Home.html) by Simon Thompson

####_Other Resources_

[Haskell Programming from First Principles](http://haskellbook.com/) is a great textbook and increasingly popular in the Haskell community. Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki are talented teachers of Haskell to novices. The book is content complete and will soon have the final and fully edited release, but you can purchase access to the ebook now. You get immediate access to the latest ‘version’ and updates as the book grows.

####_Online Help_

Other online sites also provide advice to Haskell beginners. For instance, the [Haskell Cafe](https://mail.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/haskell-cafe) mailing list is a friendly place to post queries. There are also sub-reddits like [haskellquestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/haskellquestions).
