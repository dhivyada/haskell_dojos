# haskell_dojos

Haskell playground for understanding functional programming concepts better

####Online haskell REPL:
https://tryhaskell.org/

####How to know more about the function signature, usage and examples:
You can use the ghci terminal to discover some info - if you know the fully qualified name of a function, you can ask for `:info`, e.g.

`ghci> :info Data.String.words`

For more detail about a function, try using the `:doc` command instead.

`ghci> :doc Data.String.words`

Online, you can look up documentation at [https://hackage.haskell.org/](https://hackage.haskell.org/) or you can search for functions with particular type signatures at [https://hoogle.haskell.org/](https://hoogle.haskell.org/)
